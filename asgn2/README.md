# Assignment 2 - A Little Slice of Pi - README

## Program Description
This program is a math library consisting of 6 functions. It includes 4 different methods to calculate pi,1 method to calculate Euler's number, e, and 1 method to calculate the square root of a given argument. The functions that compute pi use the Madhava series, the Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe Formula, Viete's Formula, and Euler's solution to the Basel problem. The square root function uses the Newton-Raphson method to compute the square root of a given number.

## Program Compiling
To compile the complete program, input:
>*make all*

Following this the library will be compiled and generated into multiple executable binaries, but the one used to run the library is mathlib-test.

## How to run this program

After following the compiling structions given above, input:
>*./mathlib-test

With no arguments, the library will automatically output a help message that includes information on what the library does and how to run the different functions available inside.
